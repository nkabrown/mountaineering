At the moment (Nov '18) I'm a little less than one year away from the crossing the programming 5-year mark. I've been thinking a lot about what I can do in my own time to make this last year of preparation count and cross that line a more fully developed programmer, farther along than I've been able to traverse over the last 4 years. This repo is one effort toward that goal.
